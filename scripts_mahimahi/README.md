## Case study one(real-time video with frame rate adaptation)

make\_aoi\_single.sh: start one octopus flow, and the router applies octopus in-network content adaptation(the queue type in mahimahi is dropbitrate\_dequeue)

make\_aoi\_anet.sh: start one octopus flow, and the router is active network switch\[1\](the queue type in mahimahi is dropactivenet)

## Case study two(real-time video with quality adaptation)

make\_svc\_single.sh: start one octopus flow, and the router applies octopus in-network content adaptation

make\_svc\_anet.sh: start one octopus flow, and the router is active network switch

make\_svc\_bottleneck.sh: start one octopus flow, and there are two bottleneck links (one cellular switch, and one drop-tail legacy switch)

make\_svc\_compete.sh: start one octopus flow and one backlogged BBR flow, and they share a cellular switch

make\_svc\_multi.sh: start two octopus flows, and the router applies octopus in-network content adaptation

## Case study three(real-time volumetric video)

make\_ptcloud\_single.sh: start one octopus flow, and the router applies octopus drop logic
